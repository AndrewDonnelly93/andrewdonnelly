## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andrew â€” a writer and software engineer

I blend creativity and code to build thoughtful, user-focused software and tell compelling stories.  
Iâ€™m currently working on projects with React, TypeScript, AWS CDK, and a keyboard thatâ€™s seen better days.

- ðŸ’» Mid-level full-stack dev focused on **React**, **Node.js**, and **cloud-first architecture**
- ðŸ“š Memoir-in-progress + occasional literary rabbit holes
- ðŸ§­ Travelling Europe and the world, exploring stories, and debugging life one bug at a time

> "Code is just another form of storytelling."
