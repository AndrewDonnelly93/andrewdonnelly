## 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew — a writer and software engineer with a strong focus on modern full-stack development, React ecosystems, and intuitive user experiences. I believe good software feels like poetry: structured, expressive, and intentional.

- 💻 Mid-level full-stack dev focused on **React**, **Next.js" and **Node.js*

> "Code is just another form of storytelling."
>
🔧 Currently working with:
- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Contentful, Stripe, Resend
- Node.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- CI/CD & Cloud: Vercel, AWS CDK, GitHub Actions

💡 Things I value:
- Accessibility-first UI design
- Clear, maintainable code
- Building tools that empower creatives

🌍 Based in London, working with clients across Europe and the UK  
📚 Writing a memoir and editing essays in my spare time  
🏗️ Always learning, always iterating — on code and life
🧭 Travelling Europe and the world, exploring stories, and debugging life one bug at a time
