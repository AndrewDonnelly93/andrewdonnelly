## 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew — a writer and software engineer with a strong focus on modern full-stack development, React ecosystems, and intuitive user experiences. I believe good software feels like poetry: structured, expressive, and intentional.

💻 Mid-level full-stack dev focused on React, Next.js, and Node.js

🌍 Based in London, working with clients across Europe and the UK

📚 Writing a memoir and editing essays in my spare time

🧭 Travelling Europe and the world, exploring stories, and debugging life one bug at a time

🏗️ Always learning, always iterating — on code and life

> "Code is just another form of storytelling."
>
🔧 Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript

Backend: Node.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL

Tools: Stripe, Contentful, Resend

DevOps: Vercel, AWS CDK, GitHub Actions

💡 Things I value:
- Accessibility-first UI design
- Clear, maintainable code
- Building tools that empower creatives
